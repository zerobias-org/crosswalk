name: AIUC-1 v1 to EU AI Act Crosswalk
description: >-
  This crosswalk maps requirements from AIUC-1 AI Agent Standard v1 to the
  European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). AIUC-1 provides
  practical controls that operationalize EU AI Act compliance requirements,
  particularly for high-risk AI systems under Articles 6-15. The mapping
  demonstrates how organizations implementing AIUC-1 can demonstrate
  compliance with EU regulatory requirements.
